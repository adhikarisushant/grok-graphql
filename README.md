# Full Stack TypeScript with GraphQL [![CI](https://github.com/adhikarisushant/grok-graphql/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/adhikarisushant/grok-graphql/actions/workflows/ci.yml)


## Setup

First, if you want to ensure you're using the correct Node.js and package manager versions, [install Volta](http://volta.sh)

```sh
# install Volta
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash

# install Node
volta install node
```

Then, check out a local copy of this repository

```sh
git clone git@github.com:adhikarisushant/grok-graphql
cd grok-graphql
```

Next, install the project dependencies

```sh
yarn
```

Build the project for the first time

```sh
yarn build
```

And finally, start the project

```sh
yarn dev
```

After the client and server build processes complete, you should see an "imitation Twitter" running on [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234).
